# TorontoAirbnb
If you love to travel and see the world there are always tons of hotel choices, there’s also another conventional option that’s been around for over a decade now, Airbnb.
Airbnb takes a unique approach toward lodging, it is a home-sharing platform that allows home-owners and renters (‘hosts’)¬ to put their properties (‘listings’) online, so that guests can pay to stay in them. Hosts are expected to set their own prices for their listings which could be a challenging task as it determines the number of customers for the place. 
Airbnb has recently named Toronto as one of its 10 biggest Revenue cites in the world. This study aims to build a price prediction model for the city of Toronto using techniques from Linear Regression to Gradient Boosting and other advanced Regression models that will aid hosts in setting their optimum price.
